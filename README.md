Welcome to Researchly!
I created this app because I was struggling to find ideas for a winning ISEF idea. I thought of several decent ideas in active research areas, but they were all already done, such as my idea to have a dual-axis solar panel with mirrors. Thus, I created Researchly to help people find elite-level engineering ideas that both have high potiential to win grand/special awards at ISEF and (even more importantly) have high potiential of positively impacting thousands or even millions of people that are plausible to fully research and complete within 3-4 months (example: August-December)
This app helps you find research - leading you to innovative ideas.
Tools Used:
- Vercel V0 for UI
- DeepSeek API (it was just the cheapest one that could search internet at $1.00 for 500k requests)
- Google Scholar CDN API (obviously to find research - deepseek helps actually scout the pages)
